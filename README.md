# pogorobot

the telegrambot for Pokemon Go

It can
- deliver monster-messages to users and/or groups
- deliver raid-messages to users and/or groups
- be used to submit manual raid-entries by users

Users can manually select in telegram what and where they want to see monsters and raids. 

Groups are configured in some config-files, your bot can deliver to many telegram-groups or channels. So there are different config-files for everything you might want to filter/send.


There is no need for external webservers.
