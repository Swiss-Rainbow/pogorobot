the telegrambot for Pokemon Go

It can be used for
- delivering monster-messages to users and/or groups
- delivering raid-messages to users and/or groups
- submitting manual raid-entries by users
- being webhooked up by Rocketmap, RDM, PGSS (submit an issue if you would like to have monocle or something else, needs to be tested...)

To be used it in private-mode or in groups or channels.

In private mode users can manually select in telegram what and where they want to see monsters and raids. 

There is no need for external webservers, but you need java and a database (at the moment only mysql-build exists, submit an issue if you would like to have postgres or h2).
